   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc
   - Capabilities Dashboard: http://localhost:8000/

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/capabilities`                                                   | Get all capabilities with details and current consultant assignments |
| POST   | `/capabilities/{capability_name}/register?email=consultant@slalom.com` | Register consultant for a capability                     |
| DELETE | `/capabilities/{capability_name}/unregister?email=consultant@slalom.com` | Unregister consultant from a capability              |
| GET    | `/capabilities/{capability_name}/recommendations?top_n=5` | Get ranked consultant recommendations with explainability |

## Team Matching Scoring Model

The recommendations endpoint uses deterministic weighted scoring (no ML) so ranking is transparent and repeatable.

| Factor | Weight | Details |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Skill level match | 35 | Compares consultant skill level to capability target level |
| Certification overlap | 25 | Scores overlap between consultant and capability certifications |
| Availability | 20 | Scales consultant available hours/week up to 20h |
| Practice area alignment | 10 | Full points when practice area matches |
| Industry overlap | 10 | Partial score based on shared industry verticals |

Each recommendation includes an `explainability` object with per-factor points and rationale.

## Data Model

The application uses a consulting-focused data model:

1. **Capabilities** - Uses capability name as identifier:
   - Description of the consulting capability
   - Skill levels (Emerging, Proficient, Advanced, Expert)
   - Practice area (Strategy, Technology, Operations)
   - Industry verticals served
   - Required certifications
   - List of consultant emails registered
   - Available capacity (hours per week)
   - Geographic location preferences

2. **Consultants** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Practice area
   - Skill level
   - Certifications
   - Availability

All data is currently stored in memory for this learning exercise. In a production environment, this would be backed by a robust database system.

## Future Enhancements

This exercise will guide you through implementing:
- Capability maturity assessments
- Intelligent team matching algorithms  
- Analytics dashboards for practice leads
- Integration with project management systems
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
